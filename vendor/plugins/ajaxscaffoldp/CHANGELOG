3.2.4 ========

* Patched rico_corner.js to no longer touch Object.prototype.extend which was causing the new version of
  Prototype (1.5.0) to choke on making Ajax requests, quite unfortunate. This is a re-patch of the problem
  we thought we fixed in 3.2.3.

3.2.3 ========

* Fixed clash between Rico and Prototype

3.2.1 ========

* Fixed bug with :class_name attribute being ignored

3.2.0 ==========

* Initial release
